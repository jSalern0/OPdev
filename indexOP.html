            <h2>About</h2>
             <p>Brazilian by birth, Swedish by citizenship, Bolivian by ethnicity, and Chinese at heart. I began exploring the world at the young age of 10, when I moved away from Brazil to China with my parents. Ever since then, traveling and discovering new cultures became my passion.</p>
            <p>Which brought me to making my decision of leaving my comfort zone in Sweden to move to The Netherlands to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Communication and Multimedia Design, which proved to be another passion of mine.</p> 
            <p>As a future UX designer, I look forward to being able to explore how emotions integrate with technology in the real world, as well as to design products, services, and experiences according to user behaviour.</p>

             <!-- Project 1 -->
             
               <h3>CV / Online Presence:</h3>
               <p>Developed an updated, more visual and clear version of my curriculum vitae using Adobe XD for the first time. The goal was to change the way my cv looked like by going a little bit out of the ordinary templates that companies are likely to encounter. This way I intend to stand out and make myself memorable for future employees right from the first glance they have at it.</p>

               <!-- Project 2 -->
               <h3>APP / Digital Skills:</h3>
               <p>Designed and prototyped an app that would help students like myself learn about creative techniques and rules. First contact with Adobe XD and its featured for designing apps, it certainly was a challenge to learn how to handle a new software, but it did not take long before I could manage to put things together.</p>

               <!-- Project 3 -->
               
               <h3>Processing / Free Project:</h3>
               <p>Final coded art project after a full week of programming bootcamp learning about Processing. Interactive artwork inspired by Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon album where the rainbow stripes would move following the computer's mouse.</p>

               <h3>Website / Hallmark Project:</h3>
               <p>Designed and prototyped a website for Hallmark's users to digitally unwrap a gift they have received from their loved ones from far away. The project involved bringing two people from different parts of the world together for the digital unwrapping in order to create a more bespoke experience for both of them according to their relationship. Done through Figma.</p>
