            <h2>About</h2>
             <p>Brazilian by birth, Swedish by citizenship, Bolivian by ethnicity, and Chinese at heart. I began exploring the world at the young age of 10, when I moved away from Brazil to China with my parents. Ever since then, traveling and discovering new cultures became my passion.</p>
            <p>Which brought me to making my decision of leaving my comfort zone in Sweden to move to The Netherlands to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Communication and Multimedia Design, which proved to be another passion of mine.</p> 
            <p>As a UX designer, I look forward to being able to explore how emotions integrate with technology in the real world, as well as to design products, services, and experiences according to user behaviour.</p>
