            <h2>About</h2>
             <p>Brazilian by birth, Swedish by citizenship, Bolivian by ethnicity, and Chinese at heart. I began exploring the world at the young age of 10, when I moved away from Brazil to China with my parents. Ever since then, traveling and discovering new cultures became my passion.</p>
            <p>Which brought me to making my decision of leaving my comfort zone in Sweden to move to The Netherlands to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Communication and Multimedia Design, which proved to be another passion of mine.</p> 
            <p>As a future UX designer, I look forward to being able to explore how emotions integrate with technology in the real world, as well as to design products, services, and experiences according to user behaviour.</p>

              <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
               <p>Re-designed an online supermarket's website by organizing its products into categories (through the use of Card Sorting), and modernizing its pages features such as the product overview, descrption, and check out pages. A styletile, also created by myself, aided the process of redesign so all features would match and keep a coherent form.</p>

              <h3>Project Shared Spaces</h3>
               <p>Together with a team we came up with a concept that would motivate patients at Basalt Rehabillitation Center in The Hague to make use of the center's atrium area. After much hard work through visits to the center, interviews with the workers, and inspection of how people make use of other shared spaces, we were able to come up with "Basalt Zone". A fun space that provides various activities such as gardening or exercising for the patients to invite one another to go through and therefore interact and build connections. The concept also includes the use of a key card to access the activity spaces and a post box wall to aid in communication between patients.</p>

              <h3>UX Research - User Trialling of Rijksstudio</h3>
               <p>Conducted user trials on Rijksmuseum's Rijksstudio website and app to test its usability. The aim of this research was to find out how people interact with Rijksstudio and wether it was designed in a way that their users could find their way around it easily. To do so, I gave the users tasks which they had to complete. While they attempted to complete given tasks, I observed which paths they would take and what their struggles would be.</p>

              <h3>Website / Hallmark Project</h3>
               <p>Designed and prototyped a website for Hallmark's users to digitally unwrap a gift they have received from their loved ones from far away. The project involved bringing two people from different parts of the world together for the digital unwrapping in order to create a more bespoke experience for both of them according to their relationship. Done through Figma.</p>
