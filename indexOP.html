    <section class="About">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Brazilian by birth, Swedish by citizenship, Bolivian by ethnicity, and Chinese at heart. I began exploring the world at the young age of 10, when I moved away from Brazil to China with my parents. Ever since then, traveling and discovering new cultures became my passion.</p>
      <p>Which brought me to making my decision of leaving my comfort zone in Sweden to move to The Netherlands to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Communication and Multimedia Design, which proved to be another passion of mine.</p>

    <section class="statement">
      <p>"As a UX designer, I look forward to being able to explore how emotions integrate with technology in the real world, as well as to design products, services, and experiences according to user behaviour."</p>

        <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
        <p>Re-designed an online supermarket's website by organizing its products into categories (through the use of Card Sorting), and modernizing its pages features such as the product overview, descrption, as well as the check out pages. A styletile, also created by myself, aided during my process of redesign so that all features would match and keep a coherent form.</p>

        <h3>Project Shared Spaces</h3>
        <p>Together with a team, came up with a concept to motivate patients at a rehabillitation center to make use of its atrium area. After many visits to the center, interviews, and research we were able to come up with "Basalt Zone". A fun space with various activities for the patients to invite one another to build connections. Click the button to see the final result.</p>

        <h3>UX Research of Rijksstudio</h3>
        <p>Conducted user trials on Rijksmuseum's Rijksstudio website and app to test its usability. The aim was to find out how people interact with Rijksstudio and whether it was designed so that users can find their way around it easily. To do so, users got tasks which they had to complete while I observed which paths they would take and what their struggles would be.</p>

        <h3>Website / Hallmark Project</h3>
        <p>Designed and prototyped a website for Hallmark's users to digitally unwrap a gift they have received from their loved ones from far away. The project involved bringing two people from different parts of the world together for the digital unwrapping in order to create a more bespoke experience for both of them according to their relationship. Done through Figma.</p>
